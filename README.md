# Hytter #

## Description ##

A *simple* [Hy](http://hylang.org) library to access twitter's Api

## Status ##

It currently uses a modified version of Hy which includes patches for keywords,
macros and some other stuff. It will become compatible with Hy version0.9.11

If you really really want to check it out, that version of Hy can be built from
my Hy clone ("future" branch)

## Motivation ##

This library is mostly about learning Hy, so feel free to improve any part of it.
